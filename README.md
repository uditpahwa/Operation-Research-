This is a menu driven program for solving linear programming problem with number of variables = num_var, number of equations = num_eq.
The type of constraint is to be given by the user i.e. =,<=,>=.
The specific iteration number is given by the user to be printed.
The code will always print the optimal table along with everything else.
Enter the linear system of equation one equation at at a time as prompted.
